This directory contains the files generated using the prompt that asks ChatGPT4 to create a chart using Plotly.

The only changes to the generated files by the prompt consist on replacing the names of columns (given as A, B, C, etc. through the prompt) with the real names of the columns in the CSV file, as described in the paper. Also, the name of the file was sometimes changed from myfile.csv to the actual name of the file.
